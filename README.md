# Workplace Harassment Survey Analysis

This project analyzes survey data regarding awareness and effectiveness of workplace harassment policies in the private sector. The data is processed and visualized, with a comprehensive report generated in HTML, PDF, and DOCX formats. The report includes statistical analysis, charts, and recommendations to improve workplace harassment awareness and reporting systems.

## Project Overview

This project provides insights into the following aspects of workplace harassment awareness:

1. **Awareness of Workplace Harassment**: Understanding if employees are aware of what constitutes workplace harassment.
2. **Awareness vs Reporting**: Analyzing the relationship between awareness of harassment and knowledge of reporting channels.
3. **Training vs Reporting**: Exploring whether formal training influences employees' knowledge of how to report harassment.
4. **Gender-based Awareness**: Investigating potential gender-based disparities in harassment awareness.

The project generates the following outputs:
- **HTML Report**: Interactive report with embedded charts.
- **PDF Report**: A PDF version of the report for easy sharing.
- **DOCX Executive Summary**: A Word document summarizing key findings and recommendations.
- **Excel File**: A downloadable dataset embedded in the HTML report.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas
- sqlite3
- plotly
- scipy
- jinja2
- python-docx
- weasyprint
- openpyxl (for Excel file handling)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly scipy jinja2 python-docx weasyprint openpyxl
````

```

## Usage

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (as shown in the Requirements section).

### 2. Prepare Your Data

Place the survey data file (`Awareness and Effectiveness of Workplace Harassment Policies in the Private Sector (Responses).xlsx`) in the same directory as the script.

### 3. Run the Script

Execute the `data_analysis.py` script to generate the reports:

```bash
python data_analysis.py
```

This will:

* Load and preprocess the survey data.
* Perform statistical analysis (including chi-square tests) to explore relationships in the data.
* Generate interactive charts and save them in the `/charts` folder.
* Create an HTML report with embedded charts and a downloadable Excel dataset.
* Export the HTML report to a PDF file.
* Create a Word document with an executive summary and recommendations.

### 4. View the Reports

After running the script, the following output files will be available:

* `harassment_policy_report.html`: Open this file in a browser to view the interactive report.
* `harassment_policy_report.pdf`: This file can be opened with any PDF viewer.
* `executive_summary.docx`: Open this Word document to view the executive summary and recommendations.

### 5. Download Dataset

The HTML report includes a link to download the Excel file (`survey_data.xlsx`) containing the raw survey data. The file is Base64-encoded for embedding within the report.

## Statistical Analysis

The project uses **Chi-Square tests** to evaluate relationships between different variables, such as:

* **Awareness vs Reporting**: Whether employees who are aware of what constitutes harassment also know how to report incidents.
* **Training vs Reporting**: Whether employees who have received formal training on harassment policies are more likely to know how to report harassment.
* **Gender-based Awareness**: Whether awareness of harassment differs based on gender.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to improve workplace harassment awareness and reporting systems:

1. **Mandatory Training**: Formal training should be instituted across departments to improve awareness and reporting clarity.
2. **Clarify Reporting Channels**: Low awareness of whom to report to indicates a need for clearer communication protocols.
3. **Target Gender Disparities**: Gender-based differences in awareness require tailored outreach.
4. **Continuous Learning**: Refresher programs should be scheduled periodically.
5. **Accessible Policy Documents**: Ensure policies are visible and easy to locate on internal platforms.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you'd like to improve the analysis, add new features, or report bugs, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
